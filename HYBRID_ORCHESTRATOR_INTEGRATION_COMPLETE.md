# Hybrid Orchestrator Integration - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Successfully integrated the **HybridOrchestrator** into **Stage B (StageBSelector)** to enable optimized tool selection using deterministic scoring with LLM tie-breaking.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Integrated HybridOrchestrator into StageBSelector**
   - Modified `pipeline/stages/stage_b/selector.py` to use `HybridOrchestrator` for tool selection
   - Replaced old pure-LLM selection logic with hybrid approach
   - Added adapter methods to convert between `DecisionV1` and `HybridOrchestrator` formats

### 2. **Extended Tool Optimization Profiles**
   - Added system administration tools to `pipeline/config/tool_optimization_profiles.yaml`:
     - `systemctl` - System service control (service_control, service_status capabilities)
     - `ps` - Process monitoring (system_monitoring capability)
     - `journalctl` - Log access (log_access capability)
     - `config_manager` - Configuration management (configuration_management capability)
   - Each tool includes:
     - Performance estimates (time, cost, complexity)
     - Quality metrics (accuracy, completeness)
     - Policy constraints (approval requirements, production safety)
     - Preference matching scores for different optimization modes

### 3. **Created Adapter Methods**
   - `_extract_capabilities_from_decision()` - Maps intent actions to capability names
   - `_build_orchestrator_context()` - Converts DecisionV1 context to orchestrator format
   - `_extract_inputs_from_capability()` - Maps capabilities to required inputs
   - `_build_execution_policy_from_result()` - Converts tool selection result to ExecutionPolicy
   - `_calculate_confidence_from_result()` - Calculates selection confidence based on method used

### 4. **Removed Fallback Logic**
   - Changed error handling to re-raise exceptions instead of falling back
   - Aligned with "NO FALLBACKS" system charter
   - System now fails explicitly when tool selection fails

## Architecture

```
DecisionV1 (from Stage A)
    ↓
StageBSelector.select_tools()
    ↓
[Extract capabilities & build context]
    ↓
HybridOrchestrator.select_tool()
    ↓
[Deterministic scoring + LLM tie-breaking]
    ↓
ToolSelectionResult
    ↓
[Convert to SelectionV1 format]
    ↓
SelectionV1 (to Stage C)
```

## How It Works

1. **Stage A** produces a `DecisionV1` with intent and entities
2. **StageBSelector** extracts required capabilities from the intent
3. **HybridOrchestrator** uses the optimization system:
   - Detects user preferences (fast/balanced/accurate/thorough)
   - Enumerates candidate tools from profiles
   - Enforces policy constraints (cost limits, production safety)
   - Scores candidates using deterministic algorithm
   - Detects ambiguity between top candidates
   - Uses LLM tie-breaking ONLY when ambiguous
4. **StageBSelector** converts the result to `SelectionV1` format
5. **Stage C** receives the selection for execution planning

## Test Results

### Stage B Tests: ✅ **38/38 passing**
- Tool registry tests: 7/7 ✅
- Capability matcher tests: 6/6 ✅
- Policy engine tests: 7/7 ✅
- Stage B selector tests: 10/10 ✅
- Error handling tests: 4/4 ✅
- Performance tests: 2/2 ✅

### Hybrid Optimization Tests: ✅ **80/80 passing**
- Phase 2 (Policy Enforcement): 33/33 ✅
- Phase 4 (Ambiguity Detection & LLM Tie-Breaking): 47/47 ✅

### Total: ✅ **118/118 tests passing**

## Benefits

1. **Better Tool Selection**: Uses optimization profiles with performance characteristics
2. **Policy Enforcement**: Automatically enforces cost limits, production safety, approval requirements
3. **Preference Matching**: Selects tools based on user preferences (speed vs accuracy vs cost)
4. **Deterministic When Possible**: Uses scoring algorithm for clear cases
5. **LLM Only When Needed**: Uses LLM tie-breaking only for ambiguous cases
6. **Transparent**: Provides justification and alternatives for every selection

## Files Modified

1. `pipeline/stages/stage_b/selector.py` - Integrated HybridOrchestrator
2. `pipeline/config/tool_optimization_profiles.yaml` - Added system admin tools

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Telemetry Integration**: Add telemetry logging to track selection decisions
2. **Learning System**: Implement feedback loop to improve profiles over time
3. **More Tools**: Add more tools to optimization profiles as needed
4. **Dynamic Profiles**: Support runtime profile updates based on actual performance

## Notes

- The old `ToolRegistry` system is still present but no longer used by `StageBSelector`
- The optimization profile system is now the primary tool definition mechanism
- All tools must be defined in `tool_optimization_profiles.yaml` to be selectable
- The system maintains the "NO FALLBACKS" principle - failures are explicit
