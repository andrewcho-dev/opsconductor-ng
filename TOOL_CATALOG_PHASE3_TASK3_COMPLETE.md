## Integration with Monitoring

### Prometheus Metrics

The load test validates that existing Prometheus metrics are accurate:

```yaml
# Response time metrics
tool_catalog_query_duration_seconds{quantile="0.95"} 0.00686

# Error rate metrics
tool_catalog_errors_total 0

# Cache metrics
tool_catalog_cache_hit_rate 0.9778
```

### Grafana Dashboards

Load test results can be visualized in Grafana:
1. Response time trends
2. Error rate over time
3. Throughput (requests/second)
4. Resource utilization
5. Cache effectiveness

### Alerting Rules

Based on load test results, recommended alert thresholds:

```yaml
# High response time
- alert: ToolCatalogSlowQueries
  expr: tool_catalog_query_duration_seconds{quantile="0.95"} > 0.050
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: "P95 query time exceeds 50ms"

# High error rate
- alert: ToolCatalogHighErrorRate
  expr: rate(tool_catalog_errors_total[5m]) > 0.01
  for: 2m
  annotations:
    summary: "Error rate exceeds 1%"

# Low throughput
- alert: ToolCatalogLowThroughput
  expr: rate(tool_catalog_requests_total[5m]) < 1
  for: 10m
  annotations:
    summary: "Request rate below expected threshold"
```
