# Celery Worker Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Configuration Parameter
**Problem**: The `task_send_sent_event=True` parameter was defined twice in the Celery configuration (lines 36 and 66), causing a syntax error.

**Solution**: Removed the duplicate parameter from the monitoring section, keeping only the first occurrence.

### 2. Missing Task Modules
**Problem**: Celery configuration was trying to import non-existent modules (`executor_service.tasks` and `jobs_service.tasks`), causing `ModuleNotFoundError`.

**Solution**: 
- Created a new `shared/tasks.py` module with placeholder implementations for all required tasks
- Updated Celery configuration to include `shared.tasks` instead of service-specific modules
- Updated task routing configuration to use the new module paths

## Tasks Implemented

The following Celery tasks are now available and functional:

1. **`test_task`** - Basic test task for verification
2. **`execute_job_run`** - Placeholder for job execution
3. **`execute_job_step`** - Placeholder for step execution  
4. **`process_job_request`** - Placeholder for job request processing

## Queue Configuration

Three queues are configured and working:
- **`execution`** - For job run and step execution tasks
- **`jobs`** - For job request processing tasks
- **`celery`** - Default queue for test tasks

## Verification Results

✅ All services are running and healthy:
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis broker/backend
- Celery worker

✅ All tasks execute successfully:
- Task routing works correctly
- Tasks complete with proper logging
- Results are returned as expected

✅ System is ready for integration with actual service implementations.

## Next Steps

The Celery worker is now functional with placeholder tasks. When implementing the actual services:

1. Replace placeholder task implementations with real business logic
2. Add proper error handling and retry mechanisms
3. Implement task result persistence if needed
4. Add monitoring and alerting for task failures

## Files Modified

- `shared/celery_config.py` - Fixed duplicate parameter and updated module imports
- `shared/tasks.py` - Created new file with task implementations
