# START HERE - Getting Your System Working

## You're Frustrated - I Get It

You've been working on this for months and feel like you have nothing to show. **That's about to change.**

This document will help you:
1. **Understand** what you built
2. **Fix** the hallucination problem
3. **Get** something working TODAY

---

## What You Need to Know (5 Minutes)

### **Your System in 3 Sentences:**

1. You have **170+ tools** defined in YAML files that AI can use
2. AI **queries a database** to find the right tool for each question
3. The problem: AI isn't extracting "capabilities" correctly, so it skips tool selection and **hallucinates answers**

### **The Fix (1 Hour):**

1. Fix Stage A to extract capabilities correctly (30 min)
2. Add safety net in Stage B to catch mistakes (15 min)
3. Remove hallucination fast path in Stage D (15 min)

**Result:** Asset queries will work reliably with REAL data.

## Quick Start - Get Something Working NOW

### **Option 1: Let Me Fix It (Recommended)**

I can implement all three fixes in 1 hour:

1. **Stage A**: Add explicit capability extraction rules
2. **Stage B**: Add safety net for asset queries
3. **Stage D**: Remove hallucination fast path

**Say "yes, fix it" and I'll start immediately.**

### **Option 2: Understand First, Fix Later**

1. Read UNDERSTANDING_TOOLS.md (15 min)
2. Read SYSTEM_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md (10 min)
3. Come back and ask me to implement fixes

### **Option 3: I'll Guide You Through It**

I'll explain each fix step-by-step and you make the changes.

## Your Current Problem (Simple Explanation)

```
You ask: "How many assets do we have?"
    ↓
Stage A: Analyzes question
    Problem: Returns capabilities = [] (empty!)
    ↓
Stage B: Looks for tools
    Problem: No capabilities = no tools selected
    ↓
Stage D: Generates answer
    Problem: No tools = LLM makes up data
    ↓
You get: "You have 25 assets" (FAKE DATA!)
```

**The fix:** Make Stage A return `capabilities = ["asset_management"]` so Stage B can find the asset-query tool.

---

## What You've Actually Built (You're Not Failing!)

You've created:

✅ **170+ tool definitions** in YAML format
✅ **Database-backed tool catalog** with PostgreSQL
✅ **4-stage AI pipeline** with intent classification
✅ **Hybrid orchestrator** for intelligent tool selection
✅ **Policy enforcement** for safety
✅ **Caching and performance optimization**
✅ **Hot reload** for zero-downtime updates
✅ **Telemetry and monitoring**

**This is sophisticated!** You just need to debug the capability extraction.

## What Success Looks Like (After Fixes)

```
You ask: "How many Windows assets do we have?"
    ↓
Stage A: Analyzes question
    ✅ Returns capabilities = ["asset_management"]
    ↓
Stage B: Queries database
    ✅ Finds asset-query tool
    ✅ Selects it
    ↓
Stage C: Creates execution plan
    ✅ Plans API call to asset service
    ↓
Stage D: Executes and formats
    ✅ Calls GET /api/assets?os=windows
    ✅ Gets REAL data: 47 total, 23 Windows
    ✅ Formats: "You have 47 assets. 23 are Windows."
    ↓
You get: REAL DATA! ✅
```

## Common Questions

### **Q: Why is this so complicated?**

You wanted AI to handle natural language and select tools intelligently. That requires:
- Intent classification (Stage A)
- Tool selection (Stage B)
- Execution planning (Stage C)
- Response formatting (Stage D)

Modern systems (ChatGPT, Claude) do this in one pass with 100B+ parameter models. You're using smaller models, so you need multiple stages.

### **Q: Can I simplify this?**

Yes! After we get it working, we can:
- Merge Stage A + B into one
- Remove unnecessary complexity
- Focus on 2-3 use cases that work perfectly

**But first, let's get ONE thing working.**

### **Q: How do I add new tools?**

Super easy:
1. Copy a YAML template
2. Modify tool_name, capabilities, typical_use_cases
3. Run: `python3 scripts/migrate_tools_to_db.py --file your_tool.yaml`
4. Done! AI can now use it.

See QUICK_TOOL_GUIDE.md for details.

### **Q: Why use a database for tools?**

Because you have 170+ tools! Without a database:
- Hard to search/filter
- No versioning
- No hot reload
- No performance optimization
- Can't scale to 1000+ tools

The database is actually a good choice for this scale.

### **Q: What if I just want to start over?**

**Don't!** You're 90% there. One hour of fixes and you'll have working asset queries. Then you can:
- Build confidence with one working feature
- Add more use cases incrementally
- Simplify architecture later if needed

Starting over means months more work.

## Your Decision Point

### **Path A: Fix It Now (1 Hour)**
- I implement the three fixes
- You test with asset queries
- You have something working TODAY
- **Recommended if you're exhausted**

### **Path B: Understand Then Fix (2 Hours)**
- You read the documentation
- You understand the architecture
- I implement fixes with your input
- **Recommended if you want to learn**

### **Path C: Simplify Architecture (1 Day)**
- We merge Stage A + B
- We remove complexity
- We focus on 2-3 use cases
- **Recommended if you want long-term solution**

## What I Need From You

**Just tell me:**

1. **"Fix it now"** - I'll implement all three fixes immediately
2. **"Explain first"** - I'll walk you through each fix before implementing
3. **"Let's simplify"** - We'll redesign for simplicity
4. **"I need to understand"** - I'll answer your questions first

2. **SYSTEM_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md** ← Visual guide
3. **QUICK_TOOL_GUIDE.md** ← Practical reference

---

## The Bottom Line

You're not failing. You built something sophisticated. It just needs debugging.

**One hour of fixes = working system.**

Then you can:
- Add more tools easily
- Build confidence
- Simplify later if needed
- Actually show something that works
