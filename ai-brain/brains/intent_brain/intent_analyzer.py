Simple Intent Analyzer - Understanding what the user wants

This module uses LLM intelligence to understand user intent in plain language.
No complex frameworks, no JSON parsing, no unnecessary complexity.
Just: What does the user want?

Look at this user request and determine: Is this a clear automation request that can be executed?

AUTOMATION REQUESTS ARE CLEAR when they contain:
- A clear action (ping, monitor, check, backup, etc.)
- A target (IP address, hostname, service, etc.)
- Basic parameters (frequency, thresholds, etc.)

EXAMPLES OF CLEAR REQUESTS:
- "create a job that pings 192.168.50.210 every 10 seconds" â†’ CLEAR
- "monitor disk space on server1" â†’ CLEAR  
- "check if nginx is running every 5 minutes" â†’ CLEAR
- "backup database daily at 2am" â†’ CLEAR
- "alert me when CPU usage exceeds 80%" â†’ CLEAR

ONLY ask for clarification if:
- The action is completely unclear ("do something")
- No target is specified ("monitor something")
- The request is genuinely ambiguous
