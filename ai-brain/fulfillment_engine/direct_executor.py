Direct Executor - Ollama-Driven Service Orchestration with Service Catalog

how to call them, and coordinates the execution to get results.

NOW WITH SERVICE CATALOG - Ollama knows what services are available and their capabilities!

USER REQUEST: "{user_message}"

CONTEXT FROM ANALYSIS: {extraction_text}

{service_context}

TASK: Carefully analyze the user request and reason through how to fulfill it using the available OpsConductor services.

REASONING PROCESS:
1. Break down the user request into its component parts
2. Identify which OpsConductor services are needed for each part
3. Determine the specific systems/assets involved
4. Design the commands and actions needed
5. Consider scheduling and notification requirements
6. Create a comprehensive solution

For example, if a user says "connect to each windows machine and get the system information and email it to user@email.com every 15 minutes until 11:00pm tonight":

- "each windows machine" = Need to query asset service to find all systems with OS type "Windows"
- "get the system information" = Execute appropriate Windows commands (Get-ComputerInfo, systeminfo, etc.)
- "email it to user@email.com" = Use communication service to send email notifications
- "every 15 minutes until 11:00pm tonight" = Use celery-beat scheduler for recurring execution with end time

IMPORTANT: Don't make assumptions. Use the actual services and data available. If you need Windows machines, look at the asset inventory provided. If you need to send emails, reference the communication service. If you need scheduling, reference celery-beat.

Please provide your complete reasoning and solution:

REASONING:
[Think through the request step by step, explaining how you'll use each service]

JOB_SOLUTION:
JOB_NAME: [descriptive name for the job]
DESCRIPTION: [what this job accomplishes and how]
TARGET_SYSTEMS: [specific system IDs from the asset inventory, or localhost if none available]
COMMANDS:
[actual executable commands for the target operating systems]
SCHEDULING: [if recurring/scheduled, specify the schedule requirements for celery-beat]
NOTIFICATIONS: [if notifications needed, specify what to send and how via communication service]

=== REASONING GUIDELINES ===
1. ANALYZE the user request to identify:
   - What systems are involved (query asset service)
   - What actions need to be performed (use automation service)
   - How results should be communicated (use communication service)
   - When/how often it should happen (use celery-beat for scheduling)

2. LEVERAGE SERVICES APPROPRIATELY:
   - Don't hardcode system lists - query the asset service
   - Don't assume localhost - find actual target systems
   - Don't ignore scheduling requirements - use celery-beat
   - Don't forget notification requirements - use communication service

3. CREATE EXECUTABLE SOLUTIONS:
   - Use actual system IDs from asset service
   - Generate proper commands for the target OS
   - Include proper scheduling configuration
   - Include notification configuration
