### **Response Construction Templates**
Templates that provide analysis frameworks and response patterns rather than just executing specific scripts.

### **Confidence-Based Decision Making**
Using multi-dimensional confidence scores to make intelligent decisions about response strategies.

### **Analysis Framework Engine**
Systematic evaluation methodologies that assess infrastructure, security, performance, and compliance factors.
