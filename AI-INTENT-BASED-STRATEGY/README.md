### **Intent-Based Processing**
Moving from keyword matching to understanding user intent through structured classification and reasoning.

### **4W Framework for Operational Action Normalization** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
Revolutionary systematic analysis framework that categorizes requests based on resource complexity rather than process types, focusing on WHAT action is needed, WHERE/WHAT systems are involved, WHEN it should happen, and HOW it should be executed.

### **Response Construction Templates**
Templates that provide analysis frameworks and response patterns rather than just executing specific scripts.

### **Confidence-Based Decision Making**
Using multi-dimensional confidence scores to make intelligent decisions about response strategies.

### **Analysis Framework Engine**
Systematic evaluation methodologies that assess infrastructure, security, performance, and compliance factors.
