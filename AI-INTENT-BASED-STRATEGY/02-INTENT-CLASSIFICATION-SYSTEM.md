# AI Intent-Based Strategy: Intent Classification System

## ðŸŽ¯ **4W Framework for Intent Analysis**

### Revolutionary Operational Action Normalization

**Status**: âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** (January 2025) - Replaced ITIL-based system with comprehensive 4W Framework

Our intent classification system has evolved from ITIL-based categories to a sophisticated **4W Framework** that systematically analyzes user requests through four critical dimensions, focusing on **operational action normalization** and **resource complexity assessment**.

## ðŸ§  **The 4W Framework Dimensions**

### **WHAT Analysis**: Action Type and Root Need Identification

**Purpose**: Determine the fundamental action being requested and identify underlying needs vs. surface requests

#### **Resource-Complexity Based Action Types**:

**1. INFORMATION** (Minutes effort, lightweight resources)
- Knowledge queries, status checks, documentation requests
- **Examples**: "Check server status", "Show me the logs", "What's the current CPU usage?"
- **Resource Requirements**: Read-only access, basic monitoring tools
- **Effort Estimation**: Minutes to complete

**2. OPERATIONAL** (Hours effort, standard operations)
- Routine system operations, service management, basic configurations
- **Examples**: "Restart nginx service", "Update configuration file", "Enable monitoring"
- **Resource Requirements**: Standard admin access, common tools
- **Effort Estimation**: Hours to complete

**3. DIAGNOSTIC** (Hours effort, specialized analysis)
- Problem analysis, troubleshooting, performance investigation
- **Examples**: "API returning 500 errors", "Database performance issues", "Network connectivity problems"
- **Resource Requirements**: Specialized diagnostic tools, expert knowledge
- **Effort Estimation**: Hours to days, requires analysis skills

**4. PROVISIONING** (Days effort, heavy orchestration)
- Resource creation, infrastructure deployment, complex system setup
- **Examples**: "Deploy new application stack", "Set up monitoring infrastructure", "Create development environment"
- **Resource Requirements**: Orchestration tools, multiple systems, approval workflows
- **Effort Estimation**: Days to weeks, requires coordination

#### **Root Cause Analysis**:
The framework distinguishes between **surface requests** and **underlying needs**:
```yaml
Surface Request: "Install monitoring on database servers"
Root Need: "Need visibility into database performance issues"

Surface Request: "Restart the web service"  
Root Need: "Resolve service availability problems"

Surface Request: "Add more disk space"
Root Need: "Address storage capacity constraints"
```

### **WHERE/WHAT Analysis**: Target and Scope Identification

**Purpose**: Identify what systems, components, or resources are involved and determine the scope of impact

#### **Target System Categories**:
```yaml
Infrastructure:
  - servers: ["web-server-01", "192.168.1.100", "production-db"]
  - networks: ["DMZ", "internal network", "VPN"]
  - storage: ["SAN", "backup storage", "local disk"]

Applications:
  - services: ["nginx", "mysql", "docker", "kubernetes"]
  - applications: ["web app", "API gateway", "monitoring system"]
  - databases: ["PostgreSQL", "MongoDB", "Redis"]

Environments:
  - production: ["prod", "live", "production environment"]
  - staging: ["staging", "test", "pre-prod"]
  - development: ["dev", "development", "local"]
```

#### **Scope Assessment**:
- **SINGLE**: One specific system or component
- **MULTIPLE**: Several related systems
- **ENVIRONMENT**: Entire environment (prod, staging, dev)
- **GLOBAL**: Organization-wide or cross-environment impact

#### **Impact Analysis**:
```yaml
Business Impact:
  - CRITICAL: Core business functions affected
  - HIGH: Important services impacted
  - MEDIUM: Supporting services affected
  - LOW: Development or testing systems

Technical Complexity:
  - SIMPLE: Single system, standard operation
  - MODERATE: Multiple systems, some dependencies
  - COMPLEX: Many systems, significant dependencies
  - ENTERPRISE: Cross-platform, regulatory considerations
```

### **WHEN Analysis**: Urgency and Timeline Assessment

**Purpose**: Determine the urgency level, timing constraints, and scheduling requirements

#### **Urgency Levels**:
```yaml
CRITICAL:
  - indicators: ["emergency", "urgent", "critical", "down", "outage"]
  - timeline: "Immediate action required"
  - escalation: "Automatic escalation protocols"
  - examples: ["Production system down", "Security breach", "Data loss"]

HIGH:
  - indicators: ["asap", "soon", "important", "priority"]
  - timeline: "Within hours"
  - escalation: "Management notification"
  - examples: ["Performance degradation", "Service errors", "Failed backups"]

MEDIUM:
  - indicators: ["today", "this week", "when possible"]
  - timeline: "Within days"
  - escalation: "Standard workflow"
  - examples: ["Configuration updates", "Routine maintenance", "Documentation"]

LOW:
  - indicators: ["eventually", "when convenient", "no rush"]
  - timeline: "Within weeks"
  - escalation: "Queue for planning"
  - examples: ["Optimization tasks", "Nice-to-have features", "Research"]
```

#### **Timing Constraints**:
```yaml
Scheduling Preferences:
  - IMMEDIATE: "Right now", "immediately", "urgent"
  - BUSINESS_HOURS: "During business hours", "9-5", "weekdays"
  - MAINTENANCE_WINDOW: "During maintenance", "weekend", "after hours"
  - PLANNED: "Schedule for next week", "plan for Q2", "roadmap item"

Dependencies:
  - APPROVAL_REQUIRED: "Need approval", "requires sign-off"
  - RESOURCE_DEPENDENT: "When resources available", "after current project"
  - EXTERNAL_DEPENDENT: "Waiting for vendor", "after system upgrade"
```

### **HOW Analysis**: Method Preferences and Execution Constraints

**Purpose**: Understand preferred approaches, constraints, and execution requirements

#### **Method Preferences**:
```yaml
Automation Level:
  - FULLY_AUTOMATED: "Automate this", "run automatically", "hands-off"
  - SEMI_AUTOMATED: "With approval", "guided process", "assisted"
  - MANUAL: "Step-by-step", "manual process", "I'll do it myself"
  - CONSULTATION: "Help me understand", "guidance needed", "advise me"

Approach Preferences:
  - CONSERVATIVE: "Safe approach", "minimal risk", "tested method"
  - STANDARD: "Normal process", "usual way", "standard procedure"
  - AGGRESSIVE: "Fast track", "quick solution", "bypass normal process"
  - INNOVATIVE: "New approach", "modern method", "latest technology"
```

#### **Execution Constraints**:
```yaml
Technical Constraints:
  - COMPATIBILITY: "Must work with existing systems"
  - PERFORMANCE: "Cannot impact performance"
  - SECURITY: "Must meet security requirements"

    """Identify gaps in the 4W analysis"""
    missing_info = {
        "what_missing": [],
        "where_what_missing": [],
        "when_missing": [],
        "how_missing": []
    }
    
    # Check for missing WHAT information
    if not four_w_analysis["what_analysis"]["action_type"]:

    return missing_info
```

#### **Step 3: Intelligent Clarifying Questions**

    """Generate targeted questions based on missing 4W information"""
    questions = []
    
    if "target_systems" in missing_info["where_what_missing"]:
        questions.append({
            "dimension": "WHERE/WHAT",

        })
    
    return questions
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Resource Complexity Assessment**

### **Automated Resource Complexity Scoring**

#### **Complexity Calculation Algorithm**
```python
def calculate_resource_complexity(four_w_analysis):
    """Calculate resource complexity score based on 4W analysis"""
    
    # Base complexity by action type
    action_complexity = {
        "INFORMATION": 1,      # Lightweight queries
        "OPERATIONAL": 3,      # Standard operations  
        "DIAGNOSTIC": 4,       # Specialized analysis
        "PROVISIONING": 5      # Heavy orchestration
    }
    
    # Scope multipliers
    scope_multipliers = {
        "SINGLE": 1.0,         # One system
        "MULTIPLE": 1.5,       # Several systems
        "ENVIRONMENT": 2.0,    # Entire environment
        "GLOBAL": 3.0          # Organization-wide
    }

        "LOW": 0.8             # Queue for later
    }
    
    base_score = action_complexity.get(four_w_analysis["what_analysis"]["action_type"], 3)
    scope_multiplier = scope_multipliers.get(four_w_analysis["where_what_analysis"]["scope"], 1.0)
    urgency_adjustment = urgency_adjustments.get(four_w_analysis["when_analysis"]["urgency_level"], 1.0)
    
    complexity_score = base_score * scope_multiplier * urgency_adjustment
    
    return {
        "complexity_score": complexity_score,
        "effort_estimation": estimate_effort(complexity_score),
        "resource_requirements": determine_resources(complexity_score),
        "automation_feasibility": assess_automation_feasibility(four_w_analysis)
    }
```

#### **Effort Estimation Matrix**
```yaml
Complexity Score Ranges:
  1.0-2.0:
    effort: "Minutes"
    resources: "Basic monitoring tools, read-only access"
    automation: "Fully automatable"
    examples: ["Status checks", "Log queries", "Simple reports"]
  
  2.1-4.0:
    effort: "Hours"

    effort: "Days to Weeks"
    resources: "Orchestration tools, multiple teams, approvals"
    automation: "Consultation and planning"
    examples: ["Infrastructure deployment", "Major system changes", "Enterprise rollouts"]
```

## ðŸ“Š **4W Framework Confidence Scoring**

### **Multi-Dimensional Confidence Calculation**
```python
def calculate_4w_confidence(four_w_analysis, missing_info):
    """Calculate confidence across all 4W dimensions"""
    
    dimension_weights = {
        "what_confidence": 0.35,      # Most critical - what action is needed
        "where_what_confidence": 0.25, # Important - scope and targets
        "when_confidence": 0.20,      # Timing and urgency
        "how_confidence": 0.20        # Method and constraints
    }
    
    # Calculate confidence for each dimension

    where_what_confidence = calculate_where_what_confidence(four_w_analysis["where_what_analysis"])
    when_confidence = calculate_when_confidence(four_w_analysis["when_analysis"])
    how_confidence = calculate_how_confidence(four_w_analysis["how_analysis"])
    
    # Apply missing information penalty
    missing_penalty = calculate_missing_info_penalty(missing_info)
    
    overall_confidence = (
        dimension_weights["what_confidence"] * what_confidence +
        dimension_weights["where_what_confidence"] * where_what_confidence +
        dimension_weights["when_confidence"] * when_confidence +

            "what": what_confidence,
            "where_what": where_what_confidence, 
            "when": when_confidence,
            "how": how_confidence
        },
        "missing_info_penalty": missing_penalty,
        "confidence_level": determine_confidence_level(overall_confidence)
    }
```

### **Confidence-Based Decision Thresholds**
```python
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "high_confidence": 0.85,      # Execute automation directly
    "medium_confidence": 0.70,    # Execute with confirmation  
    "low_confidence": 0.50,       # Provide manual guidance
    "clarification_needed": 0.30  # Ask clarifying questions
}

def determine_response_strategy(confidence_score, complexity_score):
    """Determine response strategy based on confidence and complexity"""
    if confidence_score >= 0.85 and complexity_score <= 4.0:
        return "AUTOMATED_EXECUTION"
    elif confidence_score >= 0.70:
        return "GUIDED_EXECUTION" 
    elif confidence_score >= 0.50:
        return "MANUAL_INSTRUCTIONS"
    else:
        return "CLARIFICATION_REQUIRED"
```

## ðŸ’¡ **Practical 4W Framework Examples**

### **Example 1: Information Request**
```yaml
User Request: "Check the status of the web server"

4W Analysis:
  WHAT:
    action_type: "INFORMATION"
    root_need: "Need visibility into web server health"
    resource_complexity: 1.2
  
  WHERE/WHAT:
    target_systems: ["web server"]
    scope: "SINGLE"
    impact: "LOW"
  
  WHEN:
    urgency_level: "MEDIUM"
    timing: "IMMEDIATE"
  
  HOW:
    automation_level: "FULLY_AUTOMATED"
    method: "STANDARD"

Result: High confidence (0.92), automated status check execution
```

### **Example 2: Provisioning Request**
```yaml
User Request: "Install monitoring on database servers"

4W Analysis:
  WHAT:
    action_type: "PROVISIONING"
    root_need: "Need visibility into database performance issues"
    resource_complexity: 7.5
  
  WHERE/WHAT:
    target_systems: ["database servers"]
    scope: "MULTIPLE"
    impact: "HIGH"
  
  WHEN:
    urgency_level: "MEDIUM"
    timing: "PLANNED"
  
  HOW:
    automation_level: "SEMI_AUTOMATED"
    method: "CONSERVATIVE"

Missing Information: Specific database servers, preferred monitoring tools
Clarifying Questions: "Which specific database servers?", "Any preferred monitoring solution?"
```

### **Example 3: Diagnostic Request**
```yaml
User Request: "API returning 500 errors"

4W Analysis:
  WHAT:
    action_type: "DIAGNOSTIC"
    root_need: "Resolve API service availability problems"
    resource_complexity: 6.0
  
  WHERE/WHAT:
    target_systems: ["API service"]
    scope: "SINGLE"
    impact: "CRITICAL"
  
  WHEN:
    urgency_level: "CRITICAL"
    timing: "IMMEDIATE"
  
  HOW:
    automation_level: "MANUAL"
    method: "STANDARD"

Result: Medium confidence (0.75), guided diagnostic process with expert consultation
```

### Entity Extraction Pipeline

#### Step 1: Named Entity Recognition
```python
def extract_named_entities(text):
    """Extract standard named entities using NLP"""
    entities = {
        "PERSON": extract_person_names(text),
        "ORG": extract_organizations(text),
        "GPE": extract_locations(text),
        "DATE": extract_dates(text),
        "TIME": extract_times(text)
    }
    return entities
```

#### Step 2: Domain-Specific Entity Extraction
```python
def extract_technical_entities(text):
    """Extract IT-specific entities"""
    entities = {

        "hostnames": extract_hostnames(text),
        "software_names": extract_software_names(text),
        "port_numbers": extract_port_numbers(text),
        "file_paths": extract_file_paths(text),
        "urls": extract_urls(text)
    }
    return entities
```

#### Step 3: Context-Aware Entity Resolution
```python
def resolve_entities_with_context(entities, system_state):
    """Resolve entities using system context"""
    resolved = {}
    
    for entity_type, entity_values in entities.items():
        resolved[entity_type] = []
        for value in entity_values:
            resolved_value = {
                "value": value,
                "confidence": calculate_entity_confidence(value, entity_type),
                "context": get_entity_context(value, system_state),
                "alternatives": find_entity_alternatives(value, system_state)
            }
            resolved[entity_type].append(resolved_value)
