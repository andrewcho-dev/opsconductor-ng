## 📊 End-to-End Validation

### Test: Echo Tool Execution
**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ai/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":"ping","tool":"echo"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "output": "pong",
  "error": null,
  "trace_id": "smoke-test-1760406250-582222",
  "duration_ms": 5.87,
  "tool": "echo"
}
```

**Flow Verified:**
```
Frontend (3100) → Kong (3000) → Automation (8010) → AI Pipeline (3005) → Echo Tool
                                                                              ↓
