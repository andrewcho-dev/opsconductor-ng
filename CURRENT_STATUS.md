# OpsConductor System - ACTUAL CURRENT STATE
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-25  
**Status:** WORKING FOUNDATION - User Management Complete

> **Reality Check:** We built a simpler but fully functional system focused on what actually works, not the original complex plan.

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE** (Working System)

### **Core Services Running:**
- ✅ **user-service** (Port 3001): Authentication + User Management combined
- ✅ **credentials-service** (Port 3004): AES-GCM encrypted credential storage
- ✅ **targets-service** (Port 3005): Target management with WinRM config
- ✅ **frontend** (Port 3000): HTML/JS web interface with user management
- ✅ **nginx** (Port 80/443): Reverse proxy with HTTPS termination
- ✅ **postgres** (Port 5432): Unified database for all services

### **Working Web Interface:**
- ✅ **Login System**: JWT authentication with access/refresh tokens
- ✅ **Dashboard**: User profile display, service status overview  
- ✅ **User Management**: Complete CRUD interface with role management
  - Create/Edit/Delete users through web UI
  - Role selection: Admin, Operator, Viewer
  - Role-based access control working
  - Color-coded role badges in user list

### **API Endpoints That Work:**
```
User Service (Port 3001):
  ✅ POST /login - Authentication with JWT tokens
  ✅ POST /register - User registration 
  ✅ GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /users - Full user CRUD
  ✅ GET /users/:id - Get user by ID

Credentials Service (Port 3004):
  ✅ POST /credentials - Create encrypted credential (admin)
  ✅ GET /credentials - List credentials (admin)
  ✅ GET /credentials/:id - Get credential metadata
  ✅ DELETE /credentials/:id - Delete credential
  ✅ POST /internal/decrypt/:id - Internal decryption

Targets Service (Port 3005):
  ✅ POST /targets - Create target
  ✅ GET /targets - List targets with pagination
  ✅ GET /targets/:id - Get target details
  ✅ PUT /targets/:id - Update target
  ✅ DELETE /targets/:id - Delete target
  ✅ POST /targets/:id/test-winrm - Mock WinRM test

Frontend (Port 3000):
  ✅ GET / - Login page
  ✅ GET /main - Dashboard (authenticated)
  ✅ GET /users - User management (admin only)
  ✅ /api/* - Proxy to backend services
```

### **Security & Authentication:**
- ✅ **JWT Tokens**: 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
- ✅ **Role-Based Access**: Admin/Operator/Viewer roles enforced
- ✅ **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with proper salting
- ✅ **HTTPS**: NGINX with SSL termination
- ✅ **Credential Encryption**: AES-GCM envelope encryption

## ❌ **WHAT WE DON'T HAVE** (Future Work)

### **Missing Core Features:**
- ❌ **Job Execution System**: No job definitions or execution engine
- ❌ **WinRM Executor**: No actual PowerShell execution capability
- ❌ **Job Scheduler**: No cron scheduling or job queue
- ❌ **Run Results**: No job run history or log storage
- ❌ **Audit System**: No audit trail or tamper-evident logging
- ❌ **Notifications**: No webhook/email alert system

### **Missing Frontend Screens:**
- ❌ **Targets UI**: API exists but no frontend interface yet
- ❌ **Jobs UI**: No job creation/management interface
- ❌ **Run History**: No job execution history
- ❌ **Schedules**: No cron scheduling interface

### **Infrastructure Not Implemented:**
- ❌ **API Gateway**: Frontend directly proxies to services
- ❌ **Separate Auth Service**: Consolidated into user-service instead
- ❌ **React Frontend**: Built HTML/JS instead (simpler, faster)

---

## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS MADE**

### **Simplifications from Original Plan:**
1. **Combined Auth**: user-service handles both auth AND user management
2. **HTML Frontend**: Vanilla JS instead of React (faster development)
3. **Direct Proxying**: No API gateway, frontend proxies directly
4. **Unified Database**: Single PostgreSQL instance vs service-specific DBs

### **Why These Work Better:**
- **Fewer moving parts** = less complexity, easier debugging
- **Faster development** = working system vs complex but broken
- **Real user testing** = actual working login/user management
- **Solid foundation** = ready to add job execution on top

## 📊 **CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS**

### **Deployment:**
```bash
# All services running via Docker Compose
docker compose ps
# Shows: postgres, user-service, credentials-service, targets-service, frontend, nginx

# Access points:
https://localhost          # Web UI
https://localhost/api/*    # API endpoints
```

### **Test Users:**
```
admin / Enabled123!       # Full admin access
choa / Enabled123!        # Admin user (Andrew)
operator / [password]     # Operator access  
```

### **Database Schema:**
- ✅ Complete `users` table with roles
- ✅ Complete `credentials` table with encryption
- ✅ Complete `targets` table with WinRM config
- ❌ Job-related tables exist but unused

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS** (When Ready)

### **Phase 2 - Job Execution Foundation:**
1. Build targets management UI (API already exists)
2. Design job definition schema and API
3. Create job management UI
4. Implement basic job queue in database

### **Phase 3 - WinRM Executor:**
1. Build Python WinRM execution service
2. Implement job run storage and logging
3. Add run history UI with live logs
4. Test against real Windows targets

### **Phase 4 - Production Features:**
1. Add audit logging system
2. Implement notification system
3. Add job scheduling (cron)
4. Performance optimization and monitoring

## 🎯 **BOTTOM LINE**

**What We Have:** A solid, working foundation for user/credential/target management with proper authentication, role-based access control, and encrypted credential storage.

**What Works:** Login, user CRUD, role management, encrypted credentials, target configuration, all through a web interface.

**What's Next:** Build job execution on top of this working foundation.

**Confidence Level:** 95% - This is a working system that users can actually use today for user and credential management.
