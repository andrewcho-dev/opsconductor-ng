- ✅ Invalid credentials: Properly rejected
- ✅ JWT tokens: Generated and validated correctly
- ✅ Role detection: Working (admin/non-admin)

### Technical Validation

## 🔧 Current Configuration

### Keycloak Settings
- **URL:** http://localhost:8090
- **Realm:** opsconductor
- **Admin:** admin/admin123
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (opsconductor.keycloak schema)

### Client Credentials
- **Frontend Client ID:** opsconductor-frontend
- **Frontend Secret:** frontend-secret-key-2024
- **API Client ID:** opsconductor-api
- **API Secret:** api-secret-key-2024

### User Accounts
- **Admin User:** admin/Admin123! (with admin role)
- **Test User:** choa/Choa123! (regular user)

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Kong Gateway Integration
- ❌ Kong routing to Keycloak not working
- ❌ Proxy access through port 3000 failing
- ✅ Direct access through port 8090 working

**Impact:** Frontend will need to connect directly to Keycloak until Kong routing is fixed.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready for Implementation)
1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update frontend to use Keycloak authentication
   - Implement token-based session management
   - Add role-based UI components

2. **API Integration**
   - Update API endpoints to validate Keycloak tokens
   - Implement middleware for token verification
   - Add role-based endpoint protection

### Short Term
1. **Kong Gateway Fix**
   - Debug Kong-Keycloak connectivity
   - Fix routing configuration
   - Test proxy authentication flow

2. **Production Preparation**
   - Environment-specific configuration
   - SSL/TLS setup
   - Performance optimization

### Long Term
1. **Legacy System Phase-out**
   - Gradual migration of remaining features
   - Remove legacy authentication code
   - Database cleanup
