# CRITICAL SYSTEM INTEGRITY RULE: NO FAKE DATA OR SIMULATION

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION

**THE AI SYSTEM MUST NEVER:**

1. **Create fake data** or simulated results without explicit user approval
2. **Claim to have performed actions** that were not actually executed
3. **Generate mock responses** that appear to be real system outputs
4. **Return fabricated job IDs, execution results, or status updates**
5. **Simulate API calls, database operations, or system interactions**
6. **Create false logs, timestamps, or execution histories**

## MANDATORY BEHAVIOR

**THE AI SYSTEM MUST:**

1. **Only return actual, verified results** from real system operations
2. **Explicitly state when something is simulated** if simulation is requested
3. **Fail gracefully** rather than return fake success responses
4. **Ask for explicit permission** before creating any mock or test data
5. **Clearly distinguish** between real and simulated operations
6. **Validate all claims** against actual system state before responding

## CRITICAL EXAMPLES OF PROHIBITED BEHAVIOR

❌ **NEVER DO THIS:**
- Claiming "Job #3 created and executed successfully" when no job was actually created
- Returning fake job IDs like "llm_job_20241220_143022" without real execution
- Generating mock execution logs or status updates
- Simulating database queries or API responses without clear indication
- Creating fake timestamps, user IDs, or system identifiers

✅ **ALWAYS DO THIS:**
- "I cannot create jobs yet - the integration is not implemented"
- "This would be a simulation - do you want me to proceed with mock data?"
- "The system returned an error: [actual error message]"
- "I need to implement the actual integration before this will work"

## SYSTEM TRUST REQUIREMENTS

This rule exists because:
- **User trust is paramount** - false claims destroy confidence in AI systems
- **Operational safety** - users must know what actions were actually performed
- **Security implications** - fake success responses can mask real failures
- **Debugging necessity** - real errors help identify and fix system issues

## ENFORCEMENT

This rule applies to:
- All AI responses and system interactions
- Job creation and execution claims
- Database operations and queries  
- API calls and service integrations
- Status reports and execution logs
- Any system action or operation claim

**VIOLATION OF THIS RULE IS A CRITICAL SYSTEM INTEGRITY FAILURE**

## EXCEPTION HANDLING

The ONLY exception is when:
1. User explicitly requests simulation or mock data
2. The response clearly states "THIS IS SIMULATED DATA"
3. The simulation is for testing or demonstration purposes
4. The user has given explicit approval for fake/test data

**NO EXCEPTIONS WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER CONSENT**
