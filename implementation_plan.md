## 🔧 **RECENT MAJOR FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**

### **✅ NGINX ROUTING FIXES** (August 27, 2025)

**Problem Resolved:**
- Frontend JavaScript errors: "Unexpected token '<', '<!doctype'... is not valid JSON"
- API calls returning HTML instead of JSON responses
- Missing routes for notification service endpoints

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ **Added Missing Notification Routes**: Complete routing for all notification endpoints
- ✅ **Fixed Route Ordering**: Specific routes before general catch-all routes
- ✅ **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintained both `/api/` and `/api/v1/` endpoint support
- ✅ **Proper JSON Responses**: All API endpoints now return JSON instead of HTML fallback

**Fixed Endpoints:**
```nginx
# Legacy notification endpoints (used by frontend)
/api/notifications              → /notifications on notification-service
/api/notification/status        → /status on notification-service
/api/notification/worker/*      → /worker/* on notification-service
/api/notification/smtp/*        → /smtp/* on notification-service
/api/notification/*             → /* on notification-service (catch-all)

# V1 API endpoints (future-proofing)
/api/v1/notifications           → /notifications on notification-service
/api/v1/notification/health     → /health on notification-service
/api/v1/worker/status           → /status on executor-service
/api/v1/scheduler/status        → /status on scheduler-service
```

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All notification endpoints return proper JSON with authentication

**Problem Resolved:**
- ✅ **Form State Management**: Fixed issue where "Create New" forms showed data from previously edited items
- ✅ **Edit vs Create Mode**: Clear distinction between editing existing records and creating new ones
- ✅ **Form Reset Logic**: Proper form state reset when switching between modes

**Pages Fixed:**
- ✅ **Targets Page**: Added resetForm() function, updated "Add Target" and Cancel buttons
- ✅ **Jobs Page**: Added resetForm() function, updated both "Create Job" buttons and Cancel button
- ✅ **Schedules Page**: Modified resetForm() function, updated "Create Schedule" and Cancel buttons
- ✅ **Credentials Page**: Added resetForm() function, updated "Add Credential" button
- ✅ **Users Page**: Added resetForm() function, updated "Add User" and Cancel buttons

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Consistent resetForm pattern across all pages
const resetForm = () => {
  setFormData({
    // Reset to initial empty state
    field1: '',
    field2: defaultValue,
    // ...
  });
  setEditingItem(null);
};

// Updated create buttons
onClick={() => {
  resetForm();
  setShowCreateModal(true);
}}
```

**User Experience Improvements:**
- ✅ **New Records**: Forms are completely blank when creating new items
