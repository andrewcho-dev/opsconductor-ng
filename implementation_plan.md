### **üí° ARCHITECTURAL CONSIDERATIONS**

#### **For Enhanced Notifications (Phase 7.2):**
- **Database Changes**: Add user_notification_preferences table
- **New Services**: Consider dedicated channel services (slack-service, teams-service)
- **Message Queue**: Implement Redis/RabbitMQ for reliable notification delivery
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement notification rate limiting to prevent spam

#### **For Security & Compliance (Phase 8):**
- **Identity Provider Integration**: SAML/OAuth2 service or integration
- **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault or Azure Key Vault integration
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced audit trail with immutable logging
- **Compliance Framework**: SOC2, ISO27001 compliance preparation

#### **For Monitoring & Analytics (Phase 9):**
- **Time Series Database**: InfluxDB or Prometheus for metrics storage
- **Data Pipeline**: ETL processes for analytics data
- **Visualization**: Grafana integration for advanced dashboards
- **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection for predictive monitoring
