- **Risk level indicators**: Visual badges with appropriate colors
- **Organized grid layout**: Information is presented in a clean, scannable format
- **Professional styling**: Consistent with the rest of the OpsConductor interface
- **Responsive design**: Works well on different screen sizes

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`/ai-brain/main.py`)
```python
# Enhanced conversation handler with Multi-Brain debug extraction
multi_brain_metadata = response.get("metadata", {})
intent_analysis_data = multi_brain_metadata.get("intent_analysis", {})
technical_plan_data = multi_brain_metadata.get("technical_plan", {})
sme_consultations = multi_brain_metadata.get("sme_consultations", {})
risk_assessment = multi_brain_metadata.get("risk_assessment", {})
```

### Frontend Changes (`/frontend/src/components/AIChat.tsx`)
```typescript
// New debug sections for Multi-Brain information
{intent?.metadata?.brains_consulted && (
  <div className="debug-section">
    <div className="debug-section-title">
      <Brain className="debug-section-icon" />
      Multi-Brain Consultations
    </div>
    // ... consultation details
  </div>
)}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Debug Mode Features

### **Toggle Functionality**
- **Button location**: Top of the chat interface
- **Visual indicator**: Eye icon (normal) / Bug icon (debug)
- **Persistent setting**: Debug mode preference is saved to localStorage
- **Real-time toggle**: Can be turned on/off without refreshing

### **Information Hierarchy**
1. **Primary**: Intent classification and confidence
2. **Context**: Risk assessment and recommendations
3. **Multi-Brain**: Brain consultations and SME expertise
4. **Technical**: Performance metrics and execution details
5. **Raw Data**: Complete response for advanced debugging

### **User Experience**
- **Non-intrusive**: Debug information only appears when explicitly enabled
- **Comprehensive**: Shows all relevant Multi-Brain processing details
- **Scannable**: Information is organized and color-coded for quick understanding
- **Professional**: Maintains the clean, technical aesthetic of OpsConductor

## ðŸš€ Multi-Brain AI Engine Integration

### **Engine Information Displayed**
- **Engine Version**: Multi-Brain AI Engine v2.0.0
- **Processing Method**: Shows "multi_brain_ai_engine" instead of legacy methods
- **Brain Consultations**: Lists Intent Brain, Technical Brain, and SME Brains
- **Confidence Aggregation**: Shows how multiple brain confidences are combined
- **Risk Assessment**: Multi-layered risk analysis from different perspectives

### **SME Brain Domains**
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes expertise
- **Security and Compliance**: Security best practices and compliance checks
- **Network Infrastructure**: Network configuration and troubleshooting
- **Database Administration**: Database management and optimization
