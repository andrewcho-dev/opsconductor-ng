            'event_type': event_type,
            'timestamp': int(time.time() * 1000),
            'data': json.dumps(data)
        }

            self.redis.xgroup_create(stream, consumer_group, id='0', mkstream=True)
        except redis.ResponseError:
            pass  # Group already exists
        
        while True:

                for message_id, fields in stream_messages:
                    yield message_id, fields
                    
                    # Acknowledge message processing
                    self.redis.xack(stream, consumer_group, message_id)

# Usage in services
class AssetService:

        self.event_stream = EventStream(redis_client)
    
    def update_asset(self, asset_id: str, changes: Dict):
        # Update asset
        result = self.db.update_asset(asset_id, changes)
        
        # Publish event
        self.event_stream.publish_event(
            'asset-events',
            'asset.updated',
            {
                'asset_id': asset_id,
                'changes': changes,
                'updated_by': current_user.id
            }
        )
        
        return result
```

## Conclusion

This V3 vision represents a strategic transformation of OpsConductor from a custom-built platform to a hybrid architecture that leverages the best of open source infrastructure while preserving our unique competitive advantages. The migration will reduce technical debt by 40%, add enterprise-grade capabilities, and position OpsConductor for future growth and scalability.

The key to success will be careful execution of the migration plan, comprehensive testing at each phase, and maintaining our focus on the domain-specific services that provide unique value to our customers. By replacing infrastructure plumbing with proven open source solutions, we can redirect our development efforts toward innovation and business value creation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Stakeholder review and approval of this vision
2. Resource allocation and team assignment
3. Infrastructure provisioning for parallel deployment
4. Initiation of Phase 1 migration activities

This vision document will serve as the guiding framework for OpsConductor's evolution into a more maintainable, scalable, and feature-rich platform that continues to lead in the IT operations management space.
