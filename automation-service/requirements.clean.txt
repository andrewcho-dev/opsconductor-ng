# ============================================================================
# REMOVED PACKAGES (Clean Architecture)
# ============================================================================
# celery==5.3.4        # Background job processing (Prefect handles this)
# flower==2.0.1         # Celery monitoring (not needed)
#
# REASONING:
# - Celery creates redundancy with Prefect orchestration
# - Clean architecture uses Prefect as single orchestration engine
# - Automation service focuses on direct, synchronous execution
# - Background processing handled by Prefect workers
