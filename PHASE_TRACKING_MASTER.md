## 🚨 RISK TRACKING

### Current Risks
1. **LLM Integration Complexity** - Phase 1 dependency on Ollama
2. **Service Integration** - Phase 2 dependency on existing services
3. **Performance Requirements** - End-to-end pipeline latency
4. **Testing Complexity** - 344 total tests across all phases

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Modular Implementation** - Each phase can be tested independently
- **Comprehensive Testing** - High test coverage per phase
- **Clean Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns
- **Incremental Delivery** - Working system after each phase
