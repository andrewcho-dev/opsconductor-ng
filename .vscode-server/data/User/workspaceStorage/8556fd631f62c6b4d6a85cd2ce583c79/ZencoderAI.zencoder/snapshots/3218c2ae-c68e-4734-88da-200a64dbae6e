# OpsConductor NG (Next Generation)

This is the **next generation** rebuild of OpsConductor - a modern, microservices-based IT operations automation platform.

## 🚀 What's New in NG

This repository contains a complete architectural rebuild with:

- **Modern Microservices Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated services
- **React + TypeScript Frontend**: Modern, responsive UI with type safety
- **FastAPI Backend Services**: High-performance Python APIs with automatic documentation
- **Docker Containerization**: Full containerized deployment with Docker Compose
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust data persistence with proper migrations
- **Nginx Load Balancer**: Production-ready reverse proxy and load balancing
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication system

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Services
- **API Gateway** (`api-gateway/`) - Central routing and authentication
- **Identity Service** (`identity-service/`) - User authentication and authorization
- **Asset Service** (`asset-service/`) - IT asset and inventory management
- **Automation Service** (`automation-service/`) - Job execution and workflow automation
- **Communication Service** (`communication-service/`) - Notifications and messaging

### Frontend
- **React Application** (`frontend/`) - Modern web interface built with React and TypeScript

### Infrastructure
- **Database** (`database/`) - PostgreSQL schemas and migrations
- **Nginx** (`nginx/`) - Reverse proxy configuration
- **SSL** (`ssl/`) - TLS certificates and security

## 🛠️ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andrewcho-dev/opsconductor-ng.git
   cd opsconductor-ng
   ```

2. **Start the platform**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x build.sh
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Web Interface: `https://your-server-ip`
   - Default credentials: `admin` / `admin123`
