# Asset Query Bug Fix - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Original Bug**: When users asked asset-related questions like "Show me all assets", the system was incorrectly selecting Prometheus monitoring tools instead of asset management tools.

**Root Cause**: The bug existed across **FOUR layers** of the system:
1. **Stage A (Intent Classification)**: Missing `asset_management` category
2. **Stage B - CapabilityMatcher**: Missing intent→capability mappings for asset_management
3. **Stage B - Selector**: Missing action→capability and capability→input mappings
4. **Database**: Tools had generic `primary_capability` instead of specific capability names

---

## ✅ Complete Fix Summary

### 1. Stage A - Intent Classification (NEW)

**Files Modified:**
- `llm/prompt_manager.py`
- `pipeline/stages/stage_a/intent_classifier.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `asset_management` as a new supported category
- Updated LLM prompts with asset_management examples and guidelines
- Added 13 asset_management actions:
  - `list_assets`, `get_asset`, `search_assets`, `count_assets`
  - `get_credentials`, `list_credentials`, `find_asset`, `query_assets`
  - `list_servers`, `list_hosts`, `get_asset_info`, `asset_count`, `asset_discovery`

**Impact**: Stage A now correctly classifies asset queries as `asset_management` category instead of `information` or `monitoring`.

---

### 2. Stage B - CapabilityMatcher

**File Modified:** `pipeline/stages/stage_b/capability_matcher.py`

**Changes Added 6 Intent→Capability Mappings:**
```python
"asset_management_list_assets": ["asset_query", "infrastructure_info", "resource_listing"]
"asset_management_get_asset": ["asset_query", "infrastructure_info"]
"asset_management_search_assets": ["asset_query", "infrastructure_info", "resource_listing"]
"asset_management_count_assets": ["asset_query", "infrastructure_info"]
"asset_management_get_credentials": ["credential_access", "secret_retrieval"]
"asset_management_list_credentials": ["credential_access", "secret_retrieval"]
```

**Impact**: CapabilityMatcher can now score asset tools correctly based on intent.

---

### 3. Stage B - Selector

**File Modified:** `pipeline/stages/stage_b/selector.py`

**Changes Added:**

**A) 6 Action→Capability Mappings:**
```python
"list_assets": ["asset_query", "infrastructure_info", "resource_listing"]
"get_asset": ["asset_query", "infrastructure_info"]
"search_assets": ["asset_query", "infrastructure_info", "resource_listing"]
"count_assets": ["asset_query", "infrastructure_info"]
"get_credentials": ["credential_access", "secret_retrieval"]
"list_credentials": ["credential_access", "secret_retrieval"]
```

**B) 5 Capability→Input Mappings:**
```python
"asset_query": ["query_type"]
"infrastructure_info": ["info_type"]
"resource_listing": ["resource_type"]
"credential_access": ["credential_id"]
"secret_retrieval": ["secret_name"]
```

**Impact**: Selector can now extract correct capabilities from asset actions and determine required inputs.

---

### 4. Database - Tool Capabilities

**File Created:** `database/fix_asset_tool_capabilities.sql`

**Changes:**
- Updated `tool_catalog.tool_capabilities` table
- Replaced generic `primary_capability` with specific capability names:
  - `asset-query` → `asset_query`, `infrastructure_info`
  - `asset-list` → `asset_query`, `infrastructure_info`, `resource_listing`
  - `asset-create/update/delete` → `asset_management`

**Impact**: Database now provides tools with proper capability names that match the code mappings.

---

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing

### Test Files Created:
1. **`tests/test_stage_b_asset_tool_selection.py`** (5 tests)
   - Real integration tests for Stage B tool selection
   - Verifies asset tools are selected (NOT prometheus)

2. **`tests/test_e2e_asset_queries_intensive.py`** (13 tests)
   - Full end-to-end pipeline tests (Stage A → B → C)
   - Uses REAL services (NO MOCKS)

### Test Coverage:

**Main Scenarios (10 tests):**
1. ✅ "Show me all assets"
2. ✅ "Show me all Linux servers"
3. ✅ "How many assets do we have?"
4. ✅ "Find all Windows servers"
5. ✅ "List all database servers"
6. ✅ "Get asset info for server web-01"
7. ✅ "Search for assets with IP 10.0.1.5"
8. ✅ "Show me all production assets"
9. ✅ "How many Linux servers are there?"
10. ✅ "Show me CPU usage" (negative test - should NOT use asset tools)

**Edge Cases (3 tests):**
1. ✅ Ambiguous phrasing: "What servers do we have?"
2. ✅ Informal phrasing: "Gimme all the assets"
3. ✅ Complex query: "Show me all Linux servers in production with more than 16GB RAM"

### Test Results:
```
✅ ALL 18 TESTS PASSED
✅ Stage A: Correctly classifies asset queries
✅ Stage B: Correctly selects asset tools (NOT prometheus)
✅ Stage C: Successfully creates execution plans
✅ Full pipeline works end-to-end
```

## 📊 System Architecture Insight

### The Three Mapping Layers

This bug revealed that the system has **THREE separate mapping layers** that must all be synchronized:

1. **CapabilityMatcher** (Stage B)
   - Maps `category_action` intents → capability names
   - Example: `asset_management_list_assets` → `["asset_query", "infrastructure_info"]`

2. **Selector** (Stage B)
   - Maps action strings → capability lists
   - Maps capability names → required inputs
   - Example: `list_assets` → `["asset_query"]` → `["query_type"]`

3. **ProfileLoader/Database** (Stage B)
   - Provides tools with those capability names
   - Example: `asset-list` tool has capabilities `["asset_query", "infrastructure_info"]`

**Critical Rule**: When adding new intent categories or tool capabilities, **ALL THREE layers must be updated**.

## 🔄 Data Flow (Fixed)

### Before Fix:
```
User: "Show me all assets"
  ↓
Stage A: category="information", action="list_resources"  ❌ WRONG
  ↓
Stage B: No asset_management mappings → defaults to system_monitoring
  ↓
Result: Selects prometheus tool  ❌ BUG
```

### After Fix:
```
User: "Show me all assets"
  ↓
Stage A: category="asset_management", action="list_assets"  ✅ CORRECT
  ↓
Stage B CapabilityMatcher: asset_management_list_assets → ["asset_query", "infrastructure_info"]
  ↓
Stage B Selector: Finds tools with asset_query capability
  ↓
Stage B ProfileLoader: Loads asset-list tool from database (has asset_query capability)
  ↓
Result: Selects asset-list tool  ✅ CORRECT
  ↓
Stage C: Creates execution plan with asset-list
  ↓
Success!  🎉
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **No Hardcoding**: Initially attempted to force YAML loading, but the correct fix was to update the database data, not bypass it.

2. **Database as Source of Truth**: The system is designed to use the database for tool definitions, not hardcoded YAML files.

3. **Four-Layer Bug**: The bug existed across four distinct layers (Stage A, CapabilityMatcher, Selector, Database), all of which needed fixing.

4. **Real Testing**: Using real services (no mocks) revealed the actual bug and validated the complete fix.

5. **Synchronization Critical**: All three mapping layers (CapabilityMatcher, Selector, Database) must stay synchronized.

## 📌 Future Considerations

1. **Adding New Categories**: When adding new intent categories:
   - Update Stage A prompts and supported categories
   - Add CapabilityMatcher intent mappings
   - Add Selector action and capability mappings
   - Ensure database tools have correct capability names

2. **Database Maintenance**: Regularly audit tool capabilities in database to ensure they match code expectations.

3. **Monitoring**: Consider adding telemetry to track which tools are selected for which intents to catch similar bugs early.

## ✨ Conclusion

The asset query bug has been **completely fixed** across all four layers:
- Stage A now recognizes asset_management category
- Stage B correctly maps intents to capabilities
- Database has proper capability definitions
- All 18 intensive E2E tests pass

The system now correctly handles all variations of asset queries and selects the appropriate asset management tools instead of prometheus.

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**
